From a young age, I have been captivated by the intersection of artificial intelligence and science fiction, a fascination that has profoundly shaped my academic and professional pursuits. This enduring interest in using technology to solve complex challenges guided me through a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science at Hellenic Open University, followed by a Master of Science (MSc) in Data Science and Machine Learning from the same institution.

My academic journey has been supplemented by targeted professional development, including certifications as a Google Data Analytics Professional and an IBM Cybersecurity Analyst. These programs have provided me with a toolkit for analyzing datasets and implementing appropriate security measures. My postgraduate studies further sharpened my expertise, allowing me to engage with advanced machine learning and statistical concepts. I have applied these competencies to a variety of practical projects—spanning natural language processing, computer vision, classification, and prediction—which solidified my practical skills and are detailed in my GitHub portfolio.

Building on this foundation, my professional goal is to pursue doctoral-level research focused on the application of deep learning in cybersecurity. My studies and personal work have reinforced my passion for this specific domain, and I am driven to research and develop intelligent systems capable of protecting individuals and organizations from ever increasing sophisticated cyber-attacks. My ambition is to contribute to the evolution of AI and help pioneer solutions for a more secure digital future.

I am constantly seeking new opportunities and challenges where I can make a meaningful difference. Driven by curiosity and growth, I am committed to having a tangible impact through AI and analytics.
