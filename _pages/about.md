I hold a BSc in Computer Science and an MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning, along with professional certifications including Google Data Analytics Professional and IBM Cybersecurity Analyst, and I am preparing to commence doctoral studies in late 2025. My research focuses on adaptive, Explainable Artificial Intelligence for cybersecurity, with particular emphasis on interpretable deep-learning approaches for detecting and mitigating Advanced Persistent Threats in SOCs.
