An early interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence and speculative futures directed my academic path toward computational problem solving. I hold a BSc in Computer Science and an MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning, along with professional certifications including Google Data Analytics Professional and IBM Cybersecurity Analyst, and I am preparing to commence doctoral studies in late 2025. My research focuses on adaptive, explainable artificial intelligence for cybersecurity, with particular emphasis on interpretable deep-learning approaches for detecting and mitigating social-engineering attacks and deepfakes. My objective is to advance rigorously validated methods that enhance the transparency, reliability, and operational utility of AI systems in security-critical contexts.
