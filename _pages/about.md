# About Me

Artificial intelligence and science fiction have captivated me since an early age. My longtime fascination with leveraging technology to uncover insights and solve complex problems has shaped my academic and professional journey.

My background includes a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Computer Science from Hellenic Open University, where I graduated with a strong academic record. Beyond formal education, I have undertaken supplemental training to build proficiency. I have completed certification programs like Google Data Analytics and IBM Cybersecurity Analyst, equipping me with skills in analyzing complex data and implementing robust security protocols. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science (MSc) in Data Science and Machine Learning from the same institution to further enhance my machine learning and statistical skills.

Throughout my studies, I have actively engaged in hands-on projects spanning natural language processing, computer vision, classification, and prediction. Applying academic concepts to real-world problems has helped deepen my practical abilities and gain experience in leveraging state-of-the-art techniques to tackle contemporary challenges. I document my ongoing work and continuous learning in my GitHub repository, which highlights my commitment to steady growth in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence.

Looking ahead, I aim to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) focused on deep learning applications in cybersecurity. My goal is to develop AI solutions that enhance security and protect individuals from attacks. I believe AI can transform digital safety when thoughtfully applied.

I am constantly seeking new opportunities and challenges where I can make a meaningful difference. Driven by curiosity and growth, I am committed to having a tangible impact through AI and analytics. Visit my GitHub profile at https://lkaragkounis.github.io/ for more information about my projects.
