Sarcasm detection model using a 1D CNN with an embedding layer, a global average pooling layer, and two dense layers. The model was trained on the [News Headlines Dataset for Sarcasm Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection) and was able to achieve an accuracy of 83% on the testing dataset. It also achieved an accuracy of 88% on the K-Fold cross-validation dataset.
